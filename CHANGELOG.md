# Changelog

All notable changes to **mdoc** are documented here.

## Unreleased

- Multi-file opening with lazy retained tabs, paths-only session restoration,
  compact sidebar navigation, and automatic PDF/DOCX conversion when OCR is
  unnecessary; explicit inline OCR choices preserve the original source.
- Slim Markdown and PDF/DOCX overflow scrollbars, horizontal preview scrolling,
  and quieter expandable conversion notices.
- Product direction, roadmap, domain glossary, and consolidated architecture
  decisions; manual build-cache cleanup instructions.
- Read-only side-by-side DOCX preview with a local Rust converter, plus a
  read-only DOCX comment list that never enters editor text.
- Literal Markdown find (Cmd/Ctrl+F, Cmd/Ctrl+G navigation, Match case
  toggle) over rendered visible text.
- Local offline OCR import for scanned PDFs on Apple Silicon macOS and
  Windows x64, with explicit setup and review warnings.
- Search-bar styling pass and Markdown search performance coverage.

## 0.1.0

- Initial standalone mdoc repository, derived from Zorite.
- File-based Markdown WYSIWYG editing with atomic saves and external-change detection.
- Side-by-side PDF viewing and local document import through AnyDoc.
- Light and dark themes, with native file actions on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
